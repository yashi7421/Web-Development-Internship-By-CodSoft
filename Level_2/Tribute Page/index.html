                    <b>When a country at the brink of independence was struggling to find its geography of unity,
                        there was one outstanding individual who took upon his shoulders the gigantic task of shaping
                        the edifice of the nation. With his indomitable spirit and relentless efforts, he made it possible
                        to integrate hundreds of remarkably diverse states to form the modern nation-state of India.
                        The name of this visionary- Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel.<a

                        Vallabhbhai Patel was born on 31st October 1875 in Nadiad, Gujarat. A successful lawyer by
                        profession, his life encountered a turning point when Mahatma Gandhi chose him as his deputy
                        commander to lead the Kheda Satyagraha in 1918. Thus, as the leader of a peasants’ protest,
                        Vallabhbhai Patel found the trajectory of his life turning towards a path of public service.<a href="https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/oct/doc2021103031.pdf">[2]</a>
                        Vallabhbhai Patel became increasingly involved with the struggle for independence. It was his
role in the Bardoli Satyagraha of 1928 that elevated him to a new pinnacle of national glory.
The peasant movement that became a subject of great discussion across the nation
demonstrated the Sardar organisational capacity and enthusiasm for tireless action. It was
here that he earned the title of Sardar, the fond epithet by which he continues to be
remembered and revered.
